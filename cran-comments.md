* This is a new release.

This is a re-submission after initial review comments to be addressed. 

Fixes addressed include:
* Description file. 'rbmi' in title and description now in single quotes. 
* Description update spelling out rbmi: reference based multiple imputation to provide context. 
* The example in gcomp_responder_multi.Rd has replaced \dontrun with \donttest. The example takes approx 8-9seconds to run. 
* A complete running example has been added to get_imputed_data.Rd removing the commented example. \donttest has been added to the example takes over 10seconds to run. 

Thank you for your time and patience,
