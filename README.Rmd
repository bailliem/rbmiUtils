`rbmiUtils` extends the functionality of [`rbmi`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rbmi) to support more streamlined workflows for multiple imputation in clinical trials. It is designed to simplify key tasks such as analysis execution, pooling, result tidying, and imputed data handling.

This package is under development and is not yet available on CRAN.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rbmiUtils` from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("openpharma/rbmiUtils")
```

This package requires the [`rbmi`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rbmi) package to be installed.

## Example

This example shows how to run a covariate-adjusted ANCOVA on imputed datasets using Bayesian multiple imputation:

```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(rbmi)
library(rbmiUtils)

data("ADMI")

# Setup
N_IMPUTATIONS <- 100
WARMUP <- 200
THIN <- 5

# Preprocessing
ADMI <- ADMI %>%
  mutate(
    TRT = factor(TRT, levels = c("Placebo", "Drug A")),
    USUBJID = factor(USUBJID),
    AVISIT = factor(AVISIT)
  )

# Define analysis variables
vars <- set_vars(
  subjid = "USUBJID",
  visit = "AVISIT",
  group = "TRT",
  outcome = "CHG",
  covariates = c("BASE", "STRATA", "REGION")
)

# Specify imputation method
method <- rbmi::method_bayes(
  n_samples = N_IMPUTATIONS,
  control = rbmi::control_bayes(
    warmup = WARMUP,
    thin = THIN
  )
)

# Run analysis
ana_obj <- analyse_mi_data(
  data = ADMI,
  vars = vars,
  method = method,
  fun = ancova
)

# Pool results and tidy
pool_obj <- pool(ana_obj)
tidy_df <- tidy_pool_obj(pool_obj)

# View results
print(tidy_df)
```

## Dataset

The package includes two example datasets for demonstrating imputation and analysis:

* `ADEFF`: An example efficacy dataset for with missing data.
* `ADMI`: A large multiple imputation dataset with 100,000 rows and multiple visits, treatment arms, and stratification variables.

Use `?ADEFF` and `?ADMI` to view full dataset documentation.

## Utilities

Key exported functions include:

* `analyse_mi_data()`: Applies an analysis function (e.g., ANCOVA) to all imputed datasets.
* `tidy_pool_obj()`: Tidies and annotates pooled results for reporting.
* `get_imputed_data()`: Extracts long-format imputed datasets with original subject IDs mapped.

These utilities wrap standard `rbmi` workflows for improved reproducibility and interpretability.

## Development Status

This package is experimental and under active development. Feedback and contributions are welcome via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openpharma/rbmiUtils/issues) or pull requests.
